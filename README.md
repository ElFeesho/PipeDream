# PipeDream
I've always wanted to write a game similar to the LoZ LTTP SNES game

## Architecture
Following the Quake 3 engine and the enforced separation of game state and rendering I am aiming to produce a similar architecture by having a server module and a client module and then a shell application that ties the two together.
